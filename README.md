## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-library-api.git
   cd bike-library-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   The project uses SQLite, which requires no additional setup. The database file will be automatically created as `bike_library.db` in the root directory.

4. **Run the API**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   - API base URL: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Swagger documentation: `http://localhost:3000/api`

## Usage

Once the API is running, you can perform the following actions:

- **Get all bikes**: `GET /bikes`
- **Get a specific bike**: `GET /bikes/:id`
- **Create a new bike**: `POST /bikes`
- **Update an existing bike**: `PUT /bikes/:id`
- **Delete a bike**: `DELETE /bikes/:id`
